		<font size="5em">Purpose:</font>
		<p>
		The primary objective of BroBase is to connect Brothers from the KW community in a faster and easier way. Brothers can find other Brothers in BroBase through common interests, hobbies, expertise, etc.
		Brothers who are not already in the BroBase will submit their information at BroBase, and that information will be eventually added by the Admins to the BroBase database. 
		</p>
		<br />
		<font size="5em">Information Sharing:</font>
		<p>
		All your information within the BroBase System will be guarded with advanced encrypted databases. 
		<b>No one will have access to the database other than the admins who can only enter the database after a rigorous log in process.</b>
		The Admins Are: Tahbit, Hussain, Huzaifa, Shafkat, Kevin, Saif and Mujtaba.<br /><br />
		The only fields that will be exposed in the Bro Search are your: <br /><b>Name, Education, Expertise and Interests.</b>
		<br />In the case where a Bro finds you on a Bro Search, he can contact you using a server generated email. 
		<br />In this process the Bro will be given a form, where he will have to enter his full name, email and the reason why he wants to contact you. 
		These 3 pieces of information will then be mailed to you by the server. <br />After you receive the email, it is your discretion 
		if you want to respond to the Bro's request or not.
		<br /><br />For more information please email: <a href="#">admins@brobase.ca</a>
